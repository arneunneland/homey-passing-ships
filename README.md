# Homey App - Passing Ships - Norway

Works with Homey Pro.

"Passing Ships" is a Homey Pro App that allows you to receive notifications when ships enter a predefined geographical area. The solution relies on Norwegian AIS data from the Norwegian Coastal Administration, accessed via Barentswatch's Live AIS API.
